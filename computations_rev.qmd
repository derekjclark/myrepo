This dataset contains a subset of the fuel economy data from the EPA. Specifically, we use the `mpg` dataset from the **ggplot2** package.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages


library(ggplot2)
```

The visualization below shows a positive, strong, and linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of these cars. Additionally, mileage is higher for cars with fewer cylinders.

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot


ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = cty, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2)
```

Other types of figure can also be drawn:

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=cyl, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=hwy, y=cty)) +
         geom_line(color="red")
```
